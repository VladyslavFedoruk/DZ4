    <h2>Fox</h2>
<p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, <br>
      upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail </p>
      <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; <br>
         these foxes are 
        either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.</p>
        <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global  <br>
             distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the <br>
              world. 
             The hunting of foxes with 
            packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>

                <h2>Short description</h2>
                <p><b>Canis</b> is a genus of the Caninae which includes multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs, coyotes, and golden jackals. Species of this <br>
                    genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well-developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.</p>
<p><b>The crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous)</b>, also known as the forest fox, wood fox, bushdog (not to be confused with the bush dog) or maikong, is an extant species of <br>
    medium-sized canid endemic to the central part of South America since at least the Pleistocene epoch.Like South American foxes, which are in the genus Lycalopex, it is not closely <br>
    related to true foxes. Cerdocyon comes from the Greek words kerdo (meaning fox) and kyon (dog) referring to the dog- and fox-like characteristics of this animal.</p>
    <p><b>The bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis)</b> is a species of fox found on the African savanna. It is the only extant species of the genus Otocyon[1] and considered a basal canid <br>
         species.Fossil records indicate this canid first appeared during the middle Pleistocene.</p>
            </div>
            <p><b>Vulpes</b> is a genus of the sub-family Caninae. The members of this genus are colloquially referred to as true foxes, meaning they form a proper clade. The word "fox" occurs <br>
                in the common names of all species of the genus, but also appears in the common names of other canid species. True foxes are distinguished from members of the genus Canis, <br>
                 such as domesticated dogs, wolves, jackals and coyotes, by their smaller size (5â€“11 kg), longer, bushier tail, and flatter skull. They have black, triangular markings between <br>
                 their eyes and nose, and the tip of their tail is often a different color from the rest of their pelt. The typical lifespan for this genus is between two and four years, but can reach <br>
                  up to a decade.
